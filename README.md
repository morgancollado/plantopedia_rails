# README

Welcome! This is the plantopedia app.

You can use this app to keep track of the plants that you own to better care for them. You can write logs about your plant to track their health. Future iterations of this app will include the ability to connect to an farmers almanac to know when to plant and harvest your garden. You will also be able to access care documentation and add data to the API to help your fellow planters.
